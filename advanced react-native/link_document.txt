<Provider store>

Makes the Redux store available to the connect() calls in the component hierarchy below. Normally, you can’t use connect() without wrapping a parent or ancestor component in <Provider>.

If you really need to, you can manually pass store as a prop to every connect()ed component, but we only recommend to do this for stubbing store in unit tests, or in non-fully-React codebases. Normally, you should just use <Provider>.

Props

store (Redux Store): The single Redux store in your application.
children (ReactElement) The root of your component hierarchy.

========================================================
connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps], [mergeProps], [options])

Connects a React component to a Redux store. connect is a facade around connectAdvanced, providing a convenient API for the most common use cases.

It does not modify the component class passed to it; instead, it returns a new, connected component class for you to use.


Arguments

[mapStateToProps(state, [ownProps]): stateProps] (Function): If this argument is specified, the new component will subscribe to Redux store updates. This means that any time the store is updated, mapStateToProps will be called. 
The results of mapStateToProps must be a plain object, which will be merged into the component’s props. If you don't want to subscribe to store updates, pass null or undefined in place of mapStateToProps.

If your mapStateToProps function is declared as taking two parameters, it will be called with the store state as the first parameter and the props passed to the connected component as the second parameter, and will also be re-invoked
whenever the connected component receives new props as determined by shallow equality comparisons. (The second parameter is normally referred to as ownProps by convention.)

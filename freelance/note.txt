_ Watch Peppa Pig or simple, basics children cartoon.
_ Don't look on grammer while spkeaking
_ Take courses
_ First try to be good at listening skills.
_ Then work on spoken skills.
_ Because you can't get good flow in spoken English till the time you don't have anyone around you to talk to you.

======================================
Lecture 5: Speed of Response

1. 
_ Replying within 24 hours
_ Calling a client is better than long emails (urgent matter, most priority...) to boost their trust with you.
_ If client has problem so tell them to call you, they will trust you.
_ Don't discuss costs and specification on call. You'll miss something. Email is better than it (few options to choose from), you can have more time.
_ Write email 2 or 3 words, 2 or 3 lines.
_ Use email for more specific specification.

*** KEY: If someone replies you early then you know that OK.

2. Dirty Tricks
_ Get dirty with Non-paying clients in urgent situations (more paid 2 to 3 times higher than normal jobs).
_ Bad clients pays right away during urgent jobs.
_ Up-front payment: "Please make the payment so I can fix your Hacked WordPress site"

======================================
Lecture 6: Professional Behavior

1. Conflict
_ Try to talk on Phone in case of conflicts (Skype, Viber... face to face). Don't get angry or try to fight with your clients. 
Try avoid bad ratings.
_ *** If you can't meet Deadline, don't take urgent projects.

2. Story
_ Never take a project you are not sure about.
_ Tell the client early that you can't complete it. Because they can really ruin your career.

*** KEY 
3. Solving your behavior problems
_ Delivery early. If deadline is 10 days, try to deliver early like in 7 days.
This will amaze your client (Wallmart do everytime).
_ Add time to deadline if you are lazy as a buffer (2 or 3 days or 1 weeks) and then delivery early.
_ Divide your project into small tasks (Foot in the door). Everyday keeps 1 or 2 trunks.

======================================
Lecture 7: Presenting your work

_ Mock up your design.
_ Never send unfinished or buggy project to a client to test (have many bugs...)
_ Upload your files HTML to FPT Server so client can see LIVE website view (test on Chrome, Firefox...)

*** KEY: buy your own domain

Lecture 13: Which project shout I take?


Question regarding project selection
Gurumayum Jason · Lecture 13 · 7 months ago
Hi Ashan,

I have a question regarding project selection. Suppose a client has posted a job to edit 100 photos, and if he is asking to edit one photo for free, just to check my skills. What should I do?

Yes, it happens in the start of your career. The first Freelance job i got was like this.

Client asked me to create a amazon like yellow button within 2 hours of testing. Once he liked my work, he hired me for more than 40 hours i guess and became one of my first permanent client.

But if you think that editing one image will take you more than 1 or 2 hours or its a long job then this is not a test :) so don't take too long tests as it will waste a lot of your time.

Q&A

Client hire some one else.....
Muhammad · Lecture 25 · 10 months ago
Dear Ahsan,

First of all I really appreciate your hard work. You said that asked for upfront and hire rate to those clients who won't pay on time(when they are in  urgency like hacked website).

Don't you think that they hire someone else instead of me and get their job done in cheap rate .....

There are two kind of mindsets when hiring someone.

1) Just get the job done with cheap rates

2) Hire a professional who delivers great at high rates

So lets take an example of a simple task like fixing a washing machine. 

Lets assume i got my automatic washing machine into some problem. Now there are two options here for me

1) Hire a local electrician on cheap rates (he might not be an expert)

2) Hire a washing machine expert that is skilled on high rates

So in option 1, there is risk involved for me, i am not sure that this local guy i hire might mess up things more.

So same thing happens with us in freelance world. Even the client hires at cheap rates first time, the second time; he will surely hire a professional rather than wasting time and money on in-experienced cheap rate freelancer

Second problem is that hiring takes time. Clients don't have that much time and they will avoid risk in such kind of urgent situations.

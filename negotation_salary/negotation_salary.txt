Lecture 3 - Two Crucial Negotations Goals

You should be say yes to the following two questions:
1. Was I prepared?
2. Did I do everything I could?

_ Being prepared means going into that negotiation having the right mindset and having confidence clearly.
_ Doing everything you can means not leaving anything on the table.

"Do you counter-offer on the salary?"
If they offer you that starting salary do you make a counter-offer?

"Do you ask for more vacation time or a higher title?"
If you don't quite get the salary you want do you push it more and ask about vacation times, what about an increased title.
The one word you're looking to avoid in all of "This is REGRET".
You're nervous in the moment, you're anxious, panic, afraid of confrontation (đối đầu)

Our two goal:
+ Prepared
+ Do everything you can

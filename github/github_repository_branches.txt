74. Pull with Rebase

// This is a good strategy when you're working on something, and you want to make sure that your changes are ahead of whatever's going on from the remote site.

// First, edit 'README.md' in remote Github and commit
+++ "Updates made on master on GitHub before rebase"

// then modify index.html in local
$ notepad index.html

$ git commit -am "Updating index.html locally before rebase"

// fetch

76. Setting Default Branch

// In some work flows, the master branch represents what's currently in production and active development SHOULD NOT happen on the master branch directly.
// Instead, there should be another branch that is also long-lived, where all the development effort goes, and then, periodically, those changes are merged back into master.
// Create new branch 'develop' and set is default branch in Settings on GitHub

// delete 'website' repository in local
QUOC CUONG@QUOCCUONG MINGW64 ~/projects
$ rm -rf website/

// re-clone, now 'develop' is the default branch
$ git clone git@github.com:CuongDuong2710/website.git

QUOC CUONG@QUOCCUONG MINGW64 ~/projects/website (develop)
$ git branch -a
* develop
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/develop
  remotes/origin/develop
  remotes/origin/master

// there was no master branch on our local system. Git went out to our remote, origin, and brought in the 'origin/master' branch and set that up as our local master branch.
$ git checkout master

$ git branch -a
  develop
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/develop
  remotes/origin/develop
  remotes/origin/master

77. Dealing with a Conflict while Pulling

// Modify 'README.md' on GitHub remote and commit
$ git checkout develop

$ git fetch

// local is not updated with remote's changes
$ git status
On branch develop
Your branch is behind 'origin/develop' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
nothing to commit, working tree clean

// edit 'README.md' on local
$ notepad README.md

$ git commit -am "Updating README with malice on local side"

$ git status
On branch develop
Your branch and 'origin/develop' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
nothing to commit, working tree clean

***// Conflict

$ git pull
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

// Fix conflict 'develop|MERGING'
QUOC CUONG@QUOCCUONG MINGW64 ~/projects/website (develop|MERGING)
$ git mergetool

QUOC CUONG@QUOCCUONG MINGW64 ~/projects/website (develop|MERGING)
$ git commit -m "resolving conflict with unique approach"

// do not have 'develop|MERGING'
QUOC CUONG@QUOCCUONG MINGW64 ~/projects/website (develop)
$ git status
On branch develop
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/develop' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        README.md.orig

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

$ rm *.orig

$ git push

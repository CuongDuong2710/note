================================================
*** 54. Fetch and Pull

// Edit file 'index.html', provide message and commit in remote repository 
<title>My website</title>

// Modify our file on our local repository REAME.md and commit
$ git commit -am "Updating README"

// We made a commit on Github directly
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean

// Try pushing up our change, Github rejected our attempt to push
// It's telling us to 'fetch' first
$ git push
To github.com:CuongDuong2710/my-website.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:CuongDuong2710/my-website.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

***// Keep in mind, 'pull' is really two commands in one; it is a 'fetch' and it is also a 'merge'.
// Git will first fetch all the updates from the remote repository, and then it will merge those changes into our current repository
***// If we dit the pull, we would automatically integrate any changes that are out on Github; however, that can be a destructive command.
// if you have changes that are not compatible with what's currently on Github
// So, one way to alleviate that is just do a 'fetch'; fetches are non-destructive
